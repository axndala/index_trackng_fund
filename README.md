# index_trackng_fund

I created this index tracking fund. It was stored in my local machine and now I want to add it to my github account.

You can set the following parameters for your own tailored J200 tracking ETF/FUND.
- Estimating Mean Variance Portfolios with Turnover Constraints
- Estimating Mean Variance Portfolios with Tracking Error Constraints
- Estimating Mean Variance Portfolios with Budgeting Constraints
